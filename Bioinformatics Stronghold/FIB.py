Rabbits and Recurrence Relations

Given: Positive integers nâ‰¤40
 and kâ‰¤5.

Return: The total number of rabbit pairs that will be present after n
 months, if we begin with 1 pair and in each generation, every pair of reproduction-age rabbits produces a litter of k
 rabbit pairs (instead of only 1 pair).
